  ### **_Built-in Annotations_**
  Built-in annotations are a set of preset Subjects, Connectors, and Notes as seen in the [Annotation Types](#types) section.

  All built-in annotation types have the following props
  - **x (number)**: X position of the subject and one end of the connector
  - **y (number)**: Y position of the subject and one end of the connector
  - **dx (number)**: X Position of the note and one end of the connector, as an offset from x,y
  - **dx (number)**: Y Position of the note and one end of the connector, as an offset from x,y
  - **nx (number)**: X Position of the note and one end of the connector, as the raw x,y position **not** an offset
  - **ny (number)**: Y Position of the note and one end of the connector, as the raw x,y position **not** an offset
  - **color(string)**: A color string that will be applied to the annotation. This color can be overridden via css
  - **events(object)**: An object with [react event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) as keys and functions to handle those events. Each handler is bound with the annotation context and has the prarameters: annotation props, annotation state, event
  - **editMode(boolean)**: Turns on handles for moving annotations, the following are only trigged with editMode on:
    - **onDragStart(function)**: Passes the current props of the annotation when dragging starts
    - **onDrag(function)**: Passes the current props of the annotation while dragging
    - **onDragEnd(function)**: Passes the current props of the annotation when dragging ends
  - **disable ([string])**: takes the values 'connector', 'subject', and 'note'. Pass them in this array if you want to disable those parts from rendering
  - **connector (object with the following properties and (values))**
    - **type (string, "line", "elbow", or "curve")**
    - **end (string, "dot", or "arrow")**
    - **curve (function):** Made to use a curve function from [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape). Defaults to \`curveCatmullRom\`.
    - **points (array[[x,y],[x,y]...])**: Anchor points for the curve function
    - **endScale (number)**: A multiplying factor for sizing the connector end
  - **note (object with the following properties and (values))**:
    - **title (string)**
    - **label (string)**
    - **padding (number)**
    - **bgPadding (number or Object with one or more options of top, bottom, left, or right)**: this allows you to add more of a padding to the rectangle behind the text element, only available in version 1.3.0 and higher
    - **orientation (string, "leftRight" or "topBottom")**: Determines based on the dx, and dy, which direction to orient the \`Note\`. Default is set to \`"topBottom"\`
    - **lineType (string, "vertical" or "horizontal")**: Creates a line along the edge of the note text. **Please Note** if you set this to \`"vertical"\` then \`orientation\` is fixed at \`"leftRight"\` and vice versa if it is \`"horizontal"\` then \`orientation\` is fixed at \`"topBottom"\`
    - **align (string, "left", "right", "middle", "top", "bottom", "dynamic")**: When the orientation is set to \`"topBottom"\` or lineType is set to \`"horiztonal"\` you can align the note with \`"top"\`, \`"bottom"\`, \`"middle"\`, or \`"dynamic"\`. When the orientation is set to \`"leftRight"\` or \`lineType\` is set to \`"vertical"\` you can align the note with \`"left"\`, \`"right"\`, \`"middle"\`, or \`"dynamic"\`. In addition to the alignment settings for the note, you can also use the css ${"`text-anchor`"} attribute to align the text within the note

  ### Selecting Elements

  - All of the visible shapes (aside from the edit handles) in the default annotations are **paths**
  - Hierarchy of classes:
  ![Annotation classes](img/classes.png)
  - Within the g.annotation-note-content there could be three additional elements: ${"`text.annotation-note-label`"}, ${"`text.annotation-note-title`"}, ${"`rect.annotation-note-bg`"}

  - There is also a color property on annotations that will easily change the color of the entire annotation.

  ### Tips

  - In addition to the alignment settings for the note, you can also use the css ${"`text-anchor`"} attribute to align the text within the note
  - There is an invisible rect (${"`rect.annotation-note-bg`"}) behind the text in the notes as a helper for more click area etc.
  - If you are importing custom fonts, you may notice the annotations don't load perfectly with text wrapping and alignment. To fix that see [this example](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/issues/33).

  ### Examples in Viz Frameworks

  - [Example](https://emeeks.github.io/semiotic/#/semiotic/annotations) with an AnnotationCalloutCircle, AnnotationXYThreshold, and AnnotationClloutElbow
  - [Wiki](https://github.com/emeeks/semiotic/wiki/Using-Annotations) on using annotations

  Reach out if you add examples to your framework and would like them listed here.

Differences from [d3-annotation](http://d3-annotation.susielu.com/)
- Component names are capitalized so \`annotationLabel\` in d3-annotation corresponds with \`AnnotationLabel\` in react-annotation
- There is no longer an annotation collection. This felt unnecessary since the annotation data was being pushed into each annotation directly
- There is no longer accessors. The assumption is that you would map over your annotations and give them the x, y, with any type of scaling functions.
- AnnotationBadge in react-annotation takes \`leftRight\` and \`topBottom\` parameters instead of the corresponding \`x\` and \`y\` parameteres in d3-annotation

If you want to update your code from d3-annotation to react-annotation, here's an example of translation:

  ### **_Composable Annotations_**
